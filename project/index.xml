      <title>Exhaustive Modeling of Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) Biosynthesis – Nathan Lewis, Lars Bode</title>

&lt;p&gt;Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are abundant and functionally important components of human milk. A growing body of evidence suggests these glycans have major impacts on the health and development of the breastfed infant. Although they were discovered more than half a century ago, their biosynthesis in the human mammary gland remains minimally characterized. We propose to develop a framework for predicting which glycosyltransferases are involved in HMO biosynthesis and identify candidate structures for poorly characterized HMOs. Our approach constructs and selects candidate models describing HMO biosynthesis, leveraging both metabolic and transcriptomic modeling and data. We will construct a generic metabolic network describing all feasible biosynthetic pathways of 34 potential HMO structures related to the 16 most abundant (&amp;gt;97% by weight) oligosaccharides found in human milk. Through the integration of HMO glycoprofiling and transcriptomics, our mechanistic modeling approach endeavors to identify the most likely HMO structures for uncharacterized HMOs, as well as specifying the association between biosynthetic reactions for those HMOs, and candidate genes for elongation and branching. These results will provide the molecular basis for HMO biosynthesis and thus can be used to guide new strategies for HMO synthesis for academic and nutritional use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AAAS: Give Science a Voice Ride</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A fundraiser for AAAS&amp;rsquo; office of government relations. AAAS is an foundational organization responsible for publishing the magazine Science. Importantly, they are in DC advocating for the funding and use of rigorously obtained information; they advocate for &amp;ldquo;evidence-based reasoning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-media&#34;&gt;Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow us on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AAAS-Give-Science-a-Voice-Ride-1842317252690197/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow us on twitter or instagram at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bike4science&amp;amp;src=typd&amp;amp;lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#bike4science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;considering-joining-the-next-ride-let-us-know-today-https-docs-google-com-forms-d-e-1faipqlsd2ijm4z0uonbro34sjr1x-kms2e5rpozl8ddst0-an1ygf4g-viewform-usp-sf-link&#34;&gt;Considering joining the next ride? &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2IJm4Z0uoNBRo34sJr1X_kMs2e5Rpozl8DDST0-aN1yGF4g/viewform?usp=sf_link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Let us know today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-raise-money-for-aaas&#34;&gt;Why raise money for AAAS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, advocates need money to be heard by our representatives. To that end, I would like to raise some money for these scientific advocates, AAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100% of donations will go directly to the AAAS Office of Government Relations. These are the folks responsible for interfacing with congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-on-aaas&#34;&gt;More on AAAS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists need representation! Representation can pressure legislators to take climate change, research funding, knowledge, and academics seriously. AAAS is that organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just joined the AAAS. If you take the opinion and work of academics seriously, join the AAAS today. Get academics the representation we need to be heard, pressure our representatives to rely on facts and reason in their decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would encourage everyone in and out of academia to join AAAS. Please encourage your friends and colleagues to do the same. #GiveKnowledgeAVoice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-aaas-today-https-www-aaas-org-membercentral-join-aaas&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aaas.org/membercentral/join-aaas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Join AAAS Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot effect change alone! My bike ride is not important, AAAS is. The more members they have, the louder and more unified our voice becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) composition in relation to risk of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) – Nathan Lewis, Lars Bode</title>
      <link>https://bkellman.github.io/project/nec-hmo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2016-312819&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A follow up on findings showing the mitigation of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) in a mouse model after administration of combined Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) as well as a single HMO: DSLNT. We found that consecutive depletion of DSLNT in the mother’s milk was correlated with NEC onset in the infant. This finding is consistent with the pre-clinical rat model suggesting that DSLNT provides a significant protective effect for preterm infants from NEC.
The project will continue with the prediction of HMO biosynthesis pathways from gene expression data and the examination of microbiome contributions to NEC onset.&lt;/p&gt;
